# UTHM Beamer Theme

This is the Beamer template made for the Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM). Background images are courtesy of Center of Academic Development (CAD) office of UTHM.

## Usage

Make sure to have all the `*.sty` and image files in the directory you are working. It's just enough to instruct Beamer to use the "ParitRaja" template with

```latex
\usetheme{ParitRaja}
```
